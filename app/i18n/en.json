		"Q1_TEXT": "The Block is a global, encrypted online marketplace where you can buy and sell with privacy.",
		"Q2_HEADER": "What are the fees?",
		"Q2_TEXT": "The listing fee is 1 USD in BBT. Unlike other popular markets, no extra fees are taken from your final sale price.",
		"Q3_HEADER": "How can I refill my wallet?",
		"Q3_TEXT": "It is possible to fill or refill your Wallet in two ways. Once you have created your Wallet, you may either send ether to it directly, or you may buy ether from within the Wallet, using bitcoin.",
		"Q4_HEADER": "What can I sell?",
		"Q4_TEXT": "You may sell anything.",
		"Q5_HEADER": "Can I buy/sell illegal items?",
		"Q5_TEXT": "BitBoost does not encourage the sale of illegal items. However, the world is a big place, and not every item is illegal, or legal, in every jurisdiction. The Terms of Use simply require that you comply with your local laws, which is your responsibility.",
		"Q6_HEADER": "Can I use BTC or other coins?",
		"Q6_TEXT": "Not at the moment. However, you may buy ether using bitcoin from within your Block Wallet. We are investigating how to bring support for buying and getting paid with more coins, including bitcoin.",
		"Q7_HEADER": "What if I lose my password?",
		"Q7_TEXT": "Your password is important. Do not lose or forget your password, or you will be unable to access your ether. The developers cannot help you if you lose your password, so be careful.",
		"Q8_HEADER": "What is filtering?",
		"Q8_TEXT": "Filtering is a way for you to control which items you see in The Block. There is no censorship in The Block, so filtering is turned on by default for your protection. You may turn filters off by clicking the Preferences tab and then the Filter toggle. You may also select new filters as they become available, or create your own. Caution: Turning all filters off may cause items to be displayed that are illegal in your jurisdiction. Proceed at your own discretion.",
		"Q9_HEADER": "How do I turn filtering on/off?",
		"Q9_TEXT": "Filter controls are on the Preferences page. Click the Preferences tab in the Dashboard panel on the left side of this application.",
		"Q10_HEADER": "What is a third-party filter?",
		"Q10_TEXT": "While the developers provide a single, default filter, it is possible for you to subscribe to more than one filter. For example, you may wish to subscribe to a filter that only hides items that are illegal in your jurisdiction, or that are inappropriate for children, or that are forbidden by your religion. We hope that filter providers will make a wide variety of third-party filters available."
