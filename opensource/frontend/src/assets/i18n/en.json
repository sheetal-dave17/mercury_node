		"PRELISTING_INTRO": "BitBoost Marketplace (BBM) was created to make e-commerce easier, to break down barriers to global trade. Ideally, everyone using this app will have a pleasant experience and a supportive, online community will form as a result. The BitBoost Team will do what we can to meet user needs.",
		"APP_INTRODUCTION": "Think of this app as a tool, like a hammer. You can use a hammer to build a house, or you could use it to commit a crime. For BitBoost Marketplace to work best, we suggest that you use this tool to build things, like a business for yourself or good relationships with other users.",
		"COOPERATION": "Now, it's up to you. Your cooperation is needed!",
		"HEADER_VALUE": "BitBoost Marketplace Terms of Use",
		"TIME_UPDATE": "Updated 18 June 2018",
		"P_1": "In general, there are only two guidelines for using this app.",
		"BULLET_1": " Always treat everyone with respect.",
		"BULLET_2": " Always be legally compliant. (Don't do anything illegal.)",
		"P_2": "Following these two rules will improve your reputation. If you do not comply with both of these rules your reputation will suffer and, if your reputation gets too low, other users may avoid you.",
		"P_3": "Therefore, reputation ratings are very important! If someone has been great to work with, give them five stars and tell other users what you liked about them. If you feel that a buyer or a seller is behaving in a way that is illegal, threatening, or otherwise seriously damaging to the community, you may give that user a negative rating. Five stars is the highest rating and one star is the lowest. No stars means the user has no ratings yet. You can choose to interact with others based on their reputation. Please be objective and honest in every rating you give.",
		"P_4": "Keep your chat conversation civil and polite to help maintain a good reputation rating. It's best to avoid cursing or using language that implies any kind of sexual intent, prejudice, hatred, or violence.",
		"P_5": "Sellers, be careful to use tags to properly identify the items in your listings. Describe your items as accurately as you can, and inform buyers of any special policies that you have so that there are no surprises. Use best practices at all times. Mislabeling your items, incomplete or misleading descriptions, and other mistakes like this, could cause buyer irritation and lower your rating.",
		"P_6": "Arbitration is available. If you have a problem with a buyer or seller, and you cannot come to a reasonable agreement with the other party, you may open a dispute and get help from an arbiter. Arbiters will be granted access to the chat histories of both parties for that listing only. The arbiter will also be able to speak directly with both the buyer and the seller involved. Once a decision ismade, the arbiter has three options: send escrowed funds to the buyer, or the seller, or a combination of both. After the dispute is settled, don't forget to rate your arbiter.",
		"P_7": "Thank you for using BitBoost Marketplace!",

		"Q3_HEADER": "How can I refill my wallet?",

		"Q8_HEADER": "What is filtering?",
		"Q8_TEXT": "Filtering is a way for you to control which items you see in BitBoost Marketplace. There is no censorship in BitBoost Marketplace, so filtering is turned on by default for your protection. You may turn filters off by clicking the Preferences tab and then the Filter toggle. You may also select new filters as they become available, or create your own. Caution: Turning all filters off may cause items to be displayed that are illegal in your jurisdiction. Proceed at your own discretion.",

		"Q10_HEADER": "What is a third-party filter?",
		"Q10_TEXT": "While the developers provide a single, default filter, it is possible for you to subscribe to more than one filter. For example, you may wish to subscribe to a filter that only hides items that are illegal in your jurisdiction, or that are inappropriate for children, or that are forbidden by your religion. We hope that filter providers will make a wide variety of third-party filters available."
