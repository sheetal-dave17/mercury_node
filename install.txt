For front-end:

- run "npm install -g --production windows-build-tools" to install python and tools
- run "npm install -g node-gyp" to install node-gyp
- run "npm install -g webpack" to install webpack
- run "npm install -g @angular/cli" to install Angular build tools
- run "npm install" from the mercury-node folder
- run "npm install" from the mercury-node/app folder
- run "npm install" from the mercury-node/app/app folder
- build the UI: "npm run-script build" from the mercury-node/app/app folder
- rebuild packages to support electron: run "npm run-script rebuild" from the mercury-node/app folder

For back-end only (debugging purposes):

- run "npm install express" from mercury-node/app folder
- install VS Code for debugging
- install Postman for issuing requests

Workaround for unicode symbols in path (Windows):

add "--devdir="C:\nodejs\nodegyp"" to npm install command
